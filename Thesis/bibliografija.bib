abstract = {Apache Kafka is a scalable publish-subscribe messaging system with its core architecture as a distributed commit log. It was originally built at LinkedIn as its centralized event pipelining platform for online data integration tasks. Over the past years developing and operating Kafka, we extend its log-structured architecture as a replicated logging backbone for much wider application scopes in the distributed environment. In this abstract, we will talk about our design and engineering experience to replicate Kafka logs for various distributed data-driven systems at LinkedIn, including source-of-truth data storage and stream processing.},

abstract = {The temporal logic of actions (TLA) is a logic for specifying and reasoning about concurrent systems. Systems and their properties are represented in the same logic, so the assertion that a system meets its specification and the assertion that one system implements another are both expressed by logical implication. TLA is very simple; its syntax and complete formal semantics are summarized in about a page. Yet, TLA is not just a logician's toy; it is extremely powerful, both in principle and in practice. This report introduces TLA and describes how it is used to specify and verify concurrent algorithms. The use of TLA to specify and reason about open systems will be described elsewhere.},
